#Foo Bar Images
##What?
Developers need images. This makes it simple. `cd` to your project directory and `clone` this repo with:

    git clone git@github.com:OscarGodson/Foo-Bar-Images.git

and voila! you have a folder with a bunch of random images.

##NOTE!
I do not claim any ownership of any of these images, aside from the bossbagel image.
